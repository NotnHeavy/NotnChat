# NotnChat
One day I was bored so I decided to work on my own chat client/server. This is like the bare minimum of a working chat, but it was a nice project to work on. Since this establishes SSL security, you'll need to generate your own SSL certificate to use. Everything else should work well from here.

If you want to test this out without relying on hosting your own server, you can connect to my own public server with the following IP: 46.101.34.136. The port is 30000, but the client defaults to that port, so you don't have to type the port in.

I'll work on some new features in the future maybe.

This uses .NET 6.0.
