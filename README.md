# NotnChat
One day I was bored so I decided to work on my own chat client/server. This is like the bare minimum of a working chat, but it was a nice project to work on. Since this establishes SSL security, you'll need to generate your own SSL certificate to use. Everything else should work well from here. 

I'll work on some new features in the future maybe.

This uses .NET 6.0.
